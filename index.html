            <li>Place your bet: Before the cards are dealt, players must place a bet. The minimum and maximum bets are usually posted on the table.</li>
            <li>Receive your cards: Once all bets have been placed, the dealer will deal two cards to each player, face up.</li>
            <li>Decide to hit or stand: After receiving your two cards, you can choose to “hit” and receive additional cards or “stand” and keep your current hand.</li>
            <li>Dealer’s turn: After all players have had their turn, the dealer will reveal their face-down card and hit or stand according to predetermined rules.</li>
            <li>Determine the winner: If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the person with the highest hand value wins.</li>
        </ol>

            <p>
                This is a decision that a player makes to order for another card from the dealer to make his hand a good hand by having a hand value of 17 or higher.
                 However if the dealer has a face-up card of 7 or higher the player should aim for a hand value of 18 or higher.
