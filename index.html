        <h2>What is Blackjack</h2>
        <p>
            Blackjack is a card game where players aim to get a hand that is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand, 
            without going over 21. Each card is worth its face value, with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) worth 10 and Aces worth either 1 or 11. 
            The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards.
            <h3>Card Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Number cards (2-10): Face value.</li>
                <li>Face cards (King, Queen, Jack): Worth 10 points.</li>
                <li>Aces: Can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which is more beneficial for the hand.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Rules of Blackjack</h2>
        <p>The goal of blackjack is simple.
            All one needs to do to win is have a higher hand value than the dealer, without going over 21. 
            Players are dealt two cards and can then choose to “hit” (receive additional cards) or “stand” (keep their current hand). 
            The dealer also receives two cards, but only one is face up.
            If a player’s hand exceeds 21, they “bust” and lose the game. 
            If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If neither the player nor the dealer busts, 
            the player with the highest hand value wins.

            <p>There are some strategies that can increase your chances of success. 
            Here are a few tips:
            <ul>
                <li>Always assume the dealer’s face-down card is worth 10.</li>
                <li>When your hand value is 12-16, hit if the dealer’s face-up card is 7 or higher.</li>
                <li>When your hand value is 17 or higher, stand.</li>
                <li>Double down on 10 or 11 when the dealer’s face-up card is 9 or lower.</li>
                <li>Never split 10s, but always split aces and 8s.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Good Hand In BlackJack</h2>
            <p>A good hand in blackjack is any hand with a value of 17 or higher. 
               However, if the dealer has a face-up card of 7 or higher, you should aim for a hand value of 18 or higher.</p>
